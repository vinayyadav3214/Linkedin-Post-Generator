        "text": "\ud83d\udd25 Huge Announcement :\n\nRaj Shamani and I are teaming up to change how India learns AI, and the ride starts now.\n\nFirst, Meet my friend Raj Shamani.\n\nIndia\u2019s biggest creator today. Billions of views. Fifteen million subscribers.\n\nYou are probably living under a rock if you havent seen him before.\n\nAnd we go way back, long before he became a creator.\n\nDuring my research I realised something scary. Generative AI education is locked away.\n\nThe best content is too technical.\n\nMost people still think AI is just ChatGPT.\n\nAnd whenever we talk about the deeper impact, people call it fear-mongering and move on.\n\nSo someone has to explain what AI can really do. At scale.\n\nIn simple language. For the whole country.\n\nRaj asked me, \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cWe teach what no one is teaching. And we make it simple.\u201d\n\nThat is how Figuring Out AI was born.\n\nEvery month, Raj and I sit for 5 to 6 hours.\n\nWe break down everything new in AI. We try tools. I show workflows. He throws problems at me. I solve them live.\n\nNothing scripted. Nothing theoretical.\n\nThe goal is simple.\n\nHelp students, working pros, founders, creators use AI to 10x, 50x, even 100x their work.\n\nFree education is powerful, but not scalable unless the loop sustains itself.\n\nEven with all our programs, we could only reach about ten million people.\n\nWith Raj\u2019s distribution plus mine, we can take this to a billion.\n\nWe already dropped Week 1.\n\nAlmost half a million people watched it in the first few days.\n\nAnd this is not a podcast. This is hands-on learning.\n\nWe will even switch roles soon. It is going to be a wild ride.\n\nNothing like this has been done in India before.\nTell me what you want us to cover next.\n\nThis is AI education at scale for India.\n\nPS : link to episode 1 in the comments.",

That\u2019s strategy. \ud83c\udfaf\n\nOpenAI understands one thing very clearly.\n\nIndia is not just another market.\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest untapped user engine in the world. \ud83c\udf0f\n\nAnd with China off the table, India is where the next billion AI users will come from.\n\nBy making ChatGPT Go free here,\n\nOpenAI has ensured that millions of students, creators, founders, coders, and consultants will now make ChatGPT part of their daily workflow. \ud83d\udcbb\n\nWhen you give users a premium experience for free, you\u2019re not just acquiring users.\n\nYou\u2019re building habits that are almost impossible to replace. \ud83d\udd01\n\nPerplexity tested this idea first with Airtel.\n\nNow OpenAI has scaled it across the country.\n\nAnd I\u2019m certain Gemini and Grok will follow next. \ud83d\udc40\n\nEvery global AI company wants to win India because our user base is not just adoption.\n\nIt\u2019s valuation fuel. \ud83d\ude80\n\nThe more Indian users they attract, the bigger the growth story they can sell to investors.\n\nI\u2019ve seen this playbook before.\n\nUber did it when I was part of the team.\n\nSubsidize India. Build traction. Raise bigger rounds. \ud83d\udcb0\n\nNow AI is the new Uber\n\nOnly this time, the scale is massive.\n\nBecause for the first time ever, AI just became free for 1.4 billion people. \ud83d\udca5\n\nSo here\u2019s the real question\u2026\n\nWill India use this window to build?\n\nOr will we just consume again? \ud83e\udd14\n\nStay tuned ,\n\nOpenAI will officially announce how to claim it on November 4th during the India Dev Day event. \ud83d\udcc5\n\nalso what are your thoughts?\n\nNote : AI was used to organise my thoughts and make it easy for anyone to read this post.",

No scrolling. No distractions.\n\nSetting it up took barely five minutes.\n\nYou just tweak Claude\u2019s config file to add Zomato\u2019s MCP endpoint, authenticate once, and restart.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Now your AI can literally talk to Zomato\u2019s backend.\n\nThe first time you see it, it feels like magic.\n\nYou ask for a restaurant, and it just happens.\n\nNo app. No UI. No friction.\n\nIt\u2019s like watching your browser tabs collapse into one clean, intelligent conversation.\n\nAnd the craziest part?\n\nClaude even finds active offers automatically, no coupon-hunting needed.\n\nZomato\u2019s MCP integration isn\u2019t just a cool feature.\n\nIt\u2019s a glimpse into the future of how invisible apps will work.\n\nNo search bars. No interfaces. Just direct intelligent action.\n\nOnce you try this, you\u2019ll never look at app interfaces the same way again.\n\nWhat do you think, is this the beginning of the end for traditional apps? \ud83d\ude80",

Search. Chat. Buy. Watch.\n\nAll through that one portal.\n\nAnd for years, that portal has belonged to Google.\n\nNot because Chrome is beautiful or fast.\n\nBut because Chrome is the default.\n\n68% of the world uses it.\n\nAnd that means 68% of the world automatically uses Google Search.\n\nNobody changes it.\n\nOut of fatigue. Out of habit. Out of \u201cit just works.\u201d\n\nThat tiny default decision has kept Google untouchable for 20 years.\n\nNow OpenAI and Perplexity are rewriting that rule.\n\nThey aren\u2019t fighting Google on search results.\n\nThey\u2019re building the place where search begins.\n\nIf you own the browser, your AI becomes the default search.\n\nYou\u2019d use ChatGPT or Perplexity without even realizing it.\n\nThat\u2019s the hidden exposure.\n\nThe invisible distribution.\n\nThe silent takeover.\n\nPerplexity saw it first with their AI-native browser, Comet.\n\nIt\u2019s already miles ahead of everyone else.\n\nOpenAI is now entering that same arena, building a browser where ChatGPT doesn\u2019t live inside a tab, it becomes the entire experience.\n\nAnd the craziest part?\n\nGoogle hasn\u2019t even joined the fight yet.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a feature war.\n\nIt\u2019s about who owns the starting point of your digital life.\n\nWho controls your attention, your queries, your data.\n\nWhen the browser becomes AI-native,\nthe OS doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nApps don\u2019t matter.\n\nEven search starts to look very different.\n\nSo yes, Sam Altman is trying to kill Google.\nNot by competing with it.\n\nBy replacing where it lives.\n\nWhen this war ends,\n\nwill we still \u201cGoogle it\u201d\n\nor will we just \u201cAsk ChatGPT\u201d?\n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text": "AI coding benchmarks are the biggest illusion in tech right now \u203c\ufe0f\n\nI spent last weekend doing something nerdy.\n\nGave the same messy function to Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5, Gemini 2.0 Pro, and GitHub Copilot.\n\nSame prompt: \u201cRefactor this to be production-ready.\u201d\n\nNow, if you've been following benchmarks, you know Claude Sonnet 4.5 is crushing it at 77.2% on SWE-bench. On paper, it\u2019s the smartest AI coder out there.\n\nBut here\u2019s what actually happened \ud83d\udc47\n- Copilot surprised me the most. It gave me code that just worked - clean, practical, production-ready. No overthinking, no fluff. I could have shipped it instantly.\nResult: https://dub.link/B18c5fx\n\n- Claude Sonnet 4.5 built me an architectural masterpiece - custom error classes, helper functions, neat async/await, and JSDoc comments. Beautiful, but for a simple refactor, it felt like overkill.\nResult: https://dub.link/Sthl9OQ\n\n- Gemini 2.0 Pro turned into a mentor - numbered comments, usage examples, and explanations for every choice. Great if you\u2019re learning, but slower if you just need code to ship.\nResult: https://dub.link/nyOWmnE\n\n- GPT-5 played it safe - defaulted to TypeScript, added type checks, and returned nulls instead of throwing. Solid, but sometimes too defensive for production needs.\nResult: https://dub.link/llr5SDz\n\nAnd that\u2019s when it clicked for me.\n\nAt this level, they can all solve the problem. The real difference is judgment.\n\nHow they handle errors. Whether they optimize for safety, speed, or clarity. Whether they\u2019re opinionated or neutral.\n\nBenchmarks will tell you who can solve problems. But production code is about taste, trade-offs, and context.\n\nSo maybe we\u2019re asking the wrong question. Instead of \u201cWhich AI is the best coder?\u201d\n\nAsk: \u201cWhich AI codes the way I think?\u201d\n\nBecause that answer will change for every developer, every team, every project.\nI run small experiments like this every week \ud83d\udd2c\n\nIf you want the full play-by-play (and results I don\u2019t always share here), you\u2019ll find them in my newsletter: https://lnkd.in/gDEUN_Tz",
